# Smart-Remote-for-the-Setup-Box-Using-Gesture-Control
The basic purpose of this project is to provide a means to control a set top box (capable of infrared
communication), in this case Hathway using hand gestures. Thus, this system will act like a remote control for
operating set top box, but this will be achieved through hand gestures instead of pushing buttons. To send and
receive remote control signals, this project uses an infrared LED as Transmitter. Using an infrared receiver, an
Arduino can detect the bits being sent by a remote control. And to playback a remote control signal, the
Arduino can flash an infrared LED at 38 kHz. With this project we can design a gesture controlled remote by
using a glove, it can be fixed to the hand, we can send any signal of any length, at any related frequency, and
thus we can design a universal remote
